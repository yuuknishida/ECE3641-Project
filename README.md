##One Paragraph Summary:
The ECE3641 Final Project encountered challenges that led to the development of a pick-and-place function triggered upon restarting the Arduino. This function is designed to pick up a block and relocate it to various positions around the robot base. Although it deviates slightly from the initial plan, the implementation of this pick-and-place process represents an innovative solution to the project's objectives.
